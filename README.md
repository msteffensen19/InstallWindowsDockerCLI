# InstallWindowsDockerCLI
##### Install Docker on Windows CLI without Docker for Windows app.


This script installs docker, docker-app and docker-compose on windows without

installing the Docker Desktop, which you might need to pay for.

A required REBOOT will occur after registry changes that allow containerization.

On a Windows machine, open a CMD windows and run this command:
    git clone https://github.com/msteffensen19/InstallWindowsDockerCLI.git
This will place two PowerShell files in your directory. Open Explorer and right-click
the file InstallWindowsDockerCLI.ps1 and select Run as Administrator.
The versions used for docker, docker-app and docker-compose are variables in the .ps1 file
